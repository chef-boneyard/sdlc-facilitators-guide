## Values, Principles, Practices

^ Short speech about relationship between principles and practices. It's hard to start with the why, and it is exactly what is expected of us. Doing _the hard right thing_ presupposes a value system that leads to improved discernment. So be brave little buckaroos, you can do this and so can your teams!

^ Run an exercise: What principles do you see at work in your teams? How do they support what your team's do? How do values and principles support practices? - Handout a list of agile, XP, and Chef values and have folks pick or circle what they see in action vs.

## What will we learn?

+ Chef Engineering Values, Principles, Practices
+ Agile and XP (just enough to be dangerous)
+ Our SDLC (how it works, how to run it, how to test, how to intervene)
+ Team Ceremony facilitation
+ Something about Modernism, Pragmatism, and Organizational Change

^ what are we getting up to today?

> Technology means ​​the knowledge of making; that is, how we create structures in the world that help us do the things that we want and need to do to thrive as human beings.
-- Yoda

## (1) Agile, A brief history

^ How did we get here? Why is process necessary? Modernist vs Post Modernist
Open source moving to product focus.  Use of XP, Kanban as proven good practices instead of trying to invent a new way starting from zero.

---
## XP in brief
What practices have helped us be successful with more satisfaction? Let's do those more!

- Is it good to test our code?  Let's test all the time.
- Is it good to work with customers (aka the business)?  Let's work together daily.
- Is it good to review code? Let's do it all the time via pairing.
- Simple design is easier to develop, validate, and maintain, so keep it as a core principle. 
- Is feedback good?  Look for opportunities to get feedback more frequently (pairing, unit tests, CI, feature demo, early release). 
- When people work too long in a day or week, their productivity and quality goes down. So set and keep a sustainable pace.

## (2) Team is a Verb
**Feature teams** are comprised of a Product Engineer, Lead Engineer, Product Designer, Software Engineers. Whole team collaborates on Epics and Features.

+ **Product Engineer** responsible for building a thing customers need, producing Epics and Features
+ **Lead Engineer** responsible for shipping and architectural supervision 
+ **Product Designer** design how customers interact with the product
+ **Software Engineer** responsible for [design, creation, testing] quality of results

Who provides advice, support, mentoring for your team?

## Conway's Law

^ organizational structure is a product of communication patterns, this means that your org structure
is a product of history, not of control - This is a good thing for change agents, but keep in mind that
change agents are never the agent of change :) It's a cruel truth and the sooner you get used to it the more helpful you will become to your colleagues and to your teams.

## (4) Ceremonies & Cadence
---

##**Standup**

+ Daily
+ <=15 minutes
+ Address Expedited Issues
+ Address anything that is blocking you in completing tasks
+ For Fixed Delivery work, are we on track or need to communicate slip
+ Review stuck (aka Blocked) issues
+ Discuss work that is being done but not on board
+  (DW: minimize towards zero)
---

##**Queue Replenishment** (aka Refinement)

+ Weekly
+ 30 minutes
+ Ensure just enough work is ready for team
+ Review items In Analysis, answer outstand questions from team. Sort
+ Review Ready for Analysis. Sort
+ Refine work [at the top of ] the Backlog, ensuring there is enough work in
+ Ready for Analysis before the next Replenishment meeting

---

##**Demo**

+ Weekly
+ 30 minutes
+ Demonstrate features shipped that week.
+ Only show work deployed to an acceptance environment

---

##**Retrospective**

+ Monthly
+ 45 minutes
+ Connect as a team to discuss process and outcomes
+ Gather information to identify
	+ What went well?
	+ What were challenges?
	+ What [few] experiments could we try to improve our process, flow, and results?


---
##**Health Check** (across teams)

+ Monthly
+ 45 minutes
+ For Engineering Leadership, Engineering Leads, Product Engineers, and Employee Experience folks
+ Each Feature team ranks their health (Red/Yellow/Green)
+ Ask the Red teams to describe their issues, providing suggestions and scheduling follow-up with Leadership
