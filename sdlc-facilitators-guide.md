## Values, Principles, Practices

^ Short speech about relationship between principles and practices. It's to start with why, and it is exactly what is expected of us. Doing _the hard right thing_ presupposes a value system that leads to improved discernment. So be brave little buckaroos, you can do this and so can your teams!

^ Run an exercise: What principles do you see at work in your teams? How do they support what your team do? How do values and principles support practices?

## Conway's Law

^ organizational structure is a product of communication patterns, this means that your org structure
is a product of history, not of control - This is a good thing for change agents, but keep in mind that
change agents are never the agent of change :) It's a cruel truth and the sooner you get used to it the more hepful you will become to your colleagues and to your teams.
